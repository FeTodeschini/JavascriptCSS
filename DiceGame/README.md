This sample generates requests for the user to input how many times a dice has to be rolled (num) and then generate 
"num" randomic values for 2 dices, showing the statistics of how many times each value was rolled (the value is the sum
of the 2 dices, which can be any number between 2 and 12, as each dice has the numbers 1 to 6).

To execute the code, simple download all the files into a local folder and double click the "dicegame.html" file.
